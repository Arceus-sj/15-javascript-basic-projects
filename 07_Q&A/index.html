                        FORTRAN is the frst programming language. It was developed by a team lead by Mr. John Backus, an American computer scientist. First appearing in 1964, FORTRAN is still in use today, predominantly helping computer scientists to conduct complex tests in areas such as numerical weather prediction, geophysics, crystallography, and computational chemistry.

                        The first programmer in the entire world was a woman. Her name was Ada Lovelace and she was born in 1815. It is believed by some people that Lovelace published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine.

                        The first “computer bug” was named that due to an actual bug. This bug was found by Grace Hopper. The computer she was building started to fail, that’s when she discovered an actual moth in the system. Since then, when something fails in either software or hardware, we call it a “bug”.
